            ---
            ## IF EVENT TYPE is "opened" (New PR):

            ### Review Process
            1. Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see all changes
            2. Read the repository's CLAUDE.md for style and conventions guidance
            3. Analyze for code quality, bugs, performance, security, and test coverage

            ### Output
            Update PR description using `gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
            ## Summary
            [1-2 sentence description of what this PR accomplishes]

            **Key Changes:**
            - [Major change 1]
            - [Major change 2]
            - [Major change 3]

            **Issues Found:**
            - [ ] [Issue 1 with file reference] <!-- ISSUE-1 -->
            - [ ] [Issue 2] <!-- ISSUE-2 -->
            (If none: "No significant issues found.")

            **Confidence Score: X/5**
            [1-2 sentence justification]

            **Important Files Changed:**
            | File | Changes |
            |------|---------|
            | `path/to/file.ts` | Brief description |

            *🤖 Last reviewed: CURRENT_SHA_SHORT at TIMESTAMP*
            EOF
            )"`

            ---
            ## IF EVENT TYPE is "synchronize" (New commits pushed):

            ### Review Process
            1. Get current PR description: `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json body -q .body`
            2. Get ONLY the new changes using: `gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/compare/${{ github.event.before }}...${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} --jq '.files[] | "File: \(.filename)\n\(.patch // "binary")\n---"'`
            3. Review ONLY these new commits - don't re-review old code
            4. Check if any previously flagged issues (marked with <!-- ISSUE-X -->) are now fixed

            ### Output
            Update the PR description:
            - Keep Summary and Key Changes unless they need updating
            - Update **Issues Found**:
              - Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for fixed issues
              - Add new issues found in the new commits
              - Remove the HTML comments (<!-- ISSUE-X -->) from fixed issues
            - Update **Confidence Score** based on current state
            - Update the "Last reviewed" timestamp and SHA
            - Add a **Review History** section if not present:
              ```
              **Review History:**
              - `SHA_SHORT`: [What changed - e.g., "Fixed issue #1, added new endpoint"]
              ```

            ## Scoring Guidelines
            - **5/5**: No issues, ready to merge
            - **4/5**: Minor issues, safe to merge with notes
            - **3/5**: Some concerns that should be addressed
            - **2/5**: Significant issues requiring changes
            - **1/5**: Critical problems, do not merge

            ## Review Guidelines
            - Be concise but thorough
            - Reference specific files when noting issues
            - Focus on substantive issues, not style nitpicks
            - For synchronize: Only flag NEW issues in the new commits
            - Be constructive and actionable
