            ---
            ## IF EVENT TYPE is "opened" (New PR):

            ### Review Process
            1. Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see all changes
            2. Read the repository's CLAUDE.md for style and conventions guidance
            3. Analyze for code quality, bugs, performance, security, and test coverage

            ### Output Format
            Update PR description using `gh pr edit ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --body "..."` with this structure:

            ```markdown
            ## Summary
            [1-2 sentence description of what this PR accomplishes]

            **Key Changes:**
            - [Major change 1]
            - [Major change 2]
            - [Major change 3]

            **Issues Found:**
            | # | Issue | File | Status |
            |---|-------|------|--------|
            | 1 | [Issue description] | `path/file.ts:line` | ⏳ Open |
            | 2 | [Issue description] | `path/file.ts:line` | ⏳ Open |

            (If no issues: display "No issues found ✅" instead of the table)

            **Confidence Score: X/5**
            [1-2 sentence justification]

            **Important Files Changed:**
            | File | Changes |
            |------|---------|
            | `path/to/file.ts` | Brief description |

            ---
            *🤖 Last reviewed: `SHORT_SHA` at TIMESTAMP*
            ```

            ---
            ## IF EVENT TYPE is "synchronize" (New commits pushed):

            ### Review Process
            1. Get current PR description: `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --json body -q .body`
            2. Get ONLY the new changes: `gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/compare/${{ github.event.before }}...${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} --jq '.files[] | "File: \(.filename)\n\(.patch // "binary")\n---"'`
            3. Review ONLY these new commits - do NOT re-review old code
            4. Check if any issues in the **Issues Found** table are now fixed

            ### Output - MINIMAL UPDATES ONLY
            You must ONLY update these sections (preserve everything else exactly):

            1. **Issues Found** table:
               - For fixed issues: Change `⏳ Open` to `✅ Fixed (\`SHORT_SHA\`)`
               - For new issues in the new commits: Add new rows with `⏳ Open`
               - Do NOT remove or renumber existing rows

            2. **Confidence Score**: Update only if issues were fixed or new issues found

            3. **Review History** (add if not present, append if exists):
               ```
               **Review History:**
               - `SHORT_SHA`: [Brief description of what changed]
               ```

            4. **Last reviewed** timestamp: Update SHA and timestamp

            DO NOT modify: Summary, Key Changes, or Important Files Changed (unless fundamentally incorrect)

            ## Scoring Guidelines
            - **5/5**: No open issues, ready to merge
            - **4/5**: Minor open issues, safe to merge with notes
            - **3/5**: Some concerns that should be addressed
            - **2/5**: Significant issues requiring changes
            - **1/5**: Critical problems, do not merge

            ## Review Guidelines
            - Be concise but thorough
            - Reference specific files and line numbers when noting issues
            - Focus on substantive issues, not style nitpicks
            - For synchronize: Only flag NEW issues in the new commits
            - Be constructive and actionable
